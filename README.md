Room Management Appliance System
A system for managing shared office, meeting, laboratory, and teaching space is to be
developed. A networked display appliance is situated outside each room. The appliance
indicates who has reserved the space and for what period. The appliance allows users to
reserve a room and check the availability of other rooms.The system is a web based scheduling system but the status of each room can be checked
at location. It incorporates the use of small flat panel displays to eliminate scheduling conflicts, interruptions, and encourage better space utilization.
The system can:
· Reserve the appropriate room when needed from any location on the network
· Display meeting information outside each room
· Easily extend room reservation with the touch screen
· Release a room if meeting finishes early
· Quickly identify occupied and available rooms by a red or green light
· Grab a room with the touch screen for an uninterrupted impromptu meeting 
Web interface
All the room displays are networked so then can be accessed via a web interface (a single
URL). Every room’s schedule can then be viewed from the web interface and maintained
by an administrator. A user should be able to check the availability of any room from the
room display and the web interface. The web interface allows for reserving rooms along
with searching tools to find available rooms at given times. All significant management
of the building’s space information will be done through this interface.
